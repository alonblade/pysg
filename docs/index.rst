Welcome to pysg's documentation!
================================

The python scene graph library *pysg* is a simple and easy to use 3D render scene graph for python using the
ModernGL_ library. It gives you the power of a scene graph which allows easy 3D object manipulation and hierarchy without
all the matrix transform headache. The render pipeline is written in ModernGL_ which makes it easy to use different
window management libraries, but also allows headless rendering and save the 3D scene images to a hard disk.
