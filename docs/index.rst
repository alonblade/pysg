Welcome to pysg's documentation!
********************************

pysg is a simple and easy to use 3D render scene graph for python using the `ModernGL
<https://github.com/cprogrammer1994/ModernGL>`_ library.
It gives you the power of a scene graph which allows easy 3D object manipulation and hierarchy without
all the matrix transform headache. The render pipeline is written in `ModernGL
<https://github.com/cprogrammer1994/ModernGL>`_ which makes it easy to use different window management
libraries, but also allows headless rendering and save the 3D scene images to a hard disk.
